# numPhy -> Numerical python 
# library used for working with array 
# contains functions for working in domain of linear algebra, foureir transform, and matrices.
# 
# provides an array object with in faster than the python list 
# "ndarray" is the array object 
# stores at one continuous place in memory unlike lists.
# 
# alias np  


# converting list and tuple into ndarray
